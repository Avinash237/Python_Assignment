PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

PEP Types:

A Standards Track PEP describes a new feature or implementation for Python. It may also describe an interoperability standard that will be supported outside the standard library for current Python versions before a subsequent PEP adds standard library support in a future version.
An Informational PEP describes a Python design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Python community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational PEPs do not necessarily represent a Python community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational PEPs or follow their advice.
A Process PEP describes a process surrounding Python, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PEPs are like Standards Track PEPs but apply to areas other than the Python language itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Python’s codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational PEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Python development. Any meta-PEP is also considered a Process PEP.

>>> # Q2.  diffrence between / and //
>>> # Ans:
>>> # /: This method of division is considered as the ‘classic division’. The ‘/’ single slash carries out the float division. The output of this operator is always a quotient with a float datatype
>>> #//: This method of division is considered the ‘true division’. The ‘//’ double slash carries out integer division which is also known as floor division. The output of this operator will be the quotient rounded off to the closest whole number
>>> # ex.
>>> 9/3
3.0
>>> 9//3
3
>>> 
>>> 
>>> # Q3.   check working of 'not in'
>>> # Ans:
>>> # Ans:Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
>>> # ex.
>>> x = ['Apple','Banana','orenge']
>>> 'mango' not in x
True
